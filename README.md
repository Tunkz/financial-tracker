<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Brief explanation about the project</h2>
This capstone is about a financial tracker that records financial transactions, displays them,
and keeps track of the date & time that the transactions took effect. This means that, for every 
transaction that was taken by a certain period of time, will be recorded and can be displayed by 
one of the options which is called <strong>ledger</strong>. The ledger is a book of accounts in which accounting 
transactions are recorded.
